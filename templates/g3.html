        In the last five years the hot month was <b>October 2013</b> , in that month JavaScript got <b>19647</b> question which is the height by any tag up to that time. If we check the months after 2013 December obviously it might have changed because in general after every month the count is increasing for all tag. In the month of <b>December</b> all most all year we can see a decrease in number of questions from the previous month commonly for all tags. Its the vacation time across the world :).
