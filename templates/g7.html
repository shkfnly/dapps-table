            I got a good response for my previous visualization <a href="http://graphoverflow.com/graphs/an-hour-on-github.html" target="_blank">"An hour in github"</a> eventually been submitted even in chromeexperiment. So one of the comments was really interesting ,it was something like "It would have been nice that we can get a data on a full day or a month" . So here it is , "A day on github".
        </p>
        <p>
            I went an fetch the whole data from <a href="http://www.githubarchive.org/" target="_blank">GitHub Archive</a>. GitHub Archive is a project by Ilya Grigorik , Thanks once again <a href="https://github.com/igrigorik" target="_blank">Ilya</a>. Yes the data was huge like 420K events one December 2014. Im sure today its more than half a million. The size was the problem , even for an hour the row JSON ~100MB so for a day its around 1GB. But I don't want that whole data, I want to show only when an event happen and what that event tagged programming language is, so the format is like this
            <img alt="github event data" src="../templates/images/g7-git/git-data-format-1.png" />  timestamps value is divided by 1000 to eliminate microsecond values , so from around 1GB of JSON data what I want is around 23MB,
        </p>
        <p>
            So even that is a huge data to parse in font-end with JavaScript, So the as a minification process I converted the data into this format
            <img alt="github event data" src="../templates/images/g7-git/git-data-format-2.png" />so now 4 event look like this formant
            <img alt="github event data" src="../templates/images/g7-git/git-data-format-4.png" />Still its not enough so I went again tried different options. I created a map of events and languages to numeric values and use this value in the event array, since it is so repetitive I got a huge reduction in size and it transformed like this
            <img alt="github event data" src="../templates/images/g7-git/git-data-format-5.png" /> as final touch created the starting time as an obejct and just replace the time from starting time. Finally able to manage to this micro format around 5MB (<a href="../js/data/git-day.json">download data</a>).
            <img alt="github event data" src="../templates/images/g7-git/git-data-format-final.png" /> So the first element in event array should be readed as ['language','type','time'] ie ['C++','ForkEvent','1417421149'] Please let me know if you have more shrinking to suggest.
        </p>

            <a href="http://threejs.org/" target="_blank">Three js</a> is used to create the scenes and animation. Each event is representated as a partice. Particle color is similar to what is used in  in <a href="http://graphoverflow.com/graphs/an-hour-on-github.html" target="_blank">"An hour on github"</a> (events tab). You can see the tag wise list of event count JavaScript, Java, Python, PHP, Ruby, CSS, C++, C.</p>
